<h1>About Krang</h1>


Krang is an open-source content-management system designed
to publish magazine websites.  It is a Perl application
which uses Apache/mod_perl and MySQL, as well as numerous
CPAN modules.

<p> 

Krang is a large application with many features, making a compact
feature list difficult to come by.  Krang provides a simple story and
media editing environment for magazine editors as well as a complete
template development environment for web designers.  On the backend,
Perl programmers can customize Krang to control the data entered in
the story editor as well as the way templates are used to build
output.  Krang was designed with flexibility and simplicity as its
highest goals.
