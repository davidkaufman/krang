<h1>SVN</h1>

<p>The first step in joining the Krang project is to checkout a copy of
Krang from our Subversion (SVN) repository.  This is the best version to use to make patches you
can send to the krang-devel mailing list.</p>

<h2>Anonymous SVN</h2>

Anonymous SVN lets you checkout a copy of the source, but won't allow
checkins.  

  svn co http://svn.krangcms.com/trunk/krang


<h2>Developer SVN</h2>

If you're a core developer on the Krang project you'll be given a
krang SVN account.  To use it, access SVN via SSL:

  svn co https://USERNAME@svn.krangcms.com/trunk/krang
